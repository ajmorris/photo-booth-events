# npm configuration
# Suppress specific deprecation warnings that cannot be fixed due to dependency constraints
# These warnings are from deep transitive dependencies controlled by @wordpress/scripts
# and don't affect plugin functionality.

# Note: Some packages (abab, domexception, inflight, @humanwhocodes/*) are deprecated
# but have no newer versions available or are controlled by @wordpress/scripts.
# These warnings are expected and safe to ignore.
